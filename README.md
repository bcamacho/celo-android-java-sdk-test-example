## How do I include the Celo Java SDK within my Android native project?
One issue I had, was the lack of hosting support for the Java SDK resulting in gradle dependancy issues. To overcome this issue, I built the library as a jar file and included it within this example project.

Follow the steps below to learn the steps to resolve issues for usage in your own project.
